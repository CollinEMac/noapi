## How To Run This Example

In the previous examples (01 - 09), we ran the examples as follows:
```sh
cd /path/to/noapi/examples/xxx
node .
```

In this example, the api service and the web service are separate, we need to start the example as follows:
```sh
cd /path/to/noapi/examples/xxx/web # <- Note the ending is /web
node .
```

However, when we switch to this example, we will habitually follow the previous operations and go wrong. Therefore, a shortcut (index.js) is provided here. 

Now, we can run this example as same as the previous examples, like below:
```sh
cd /path/to/noapi/examples/xxx
node .
```
